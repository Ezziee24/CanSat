# Team SETTellite - ESP32-Cam
In this folder are the references for the making of the ESP32-Cam. The camerawebserver.ino file is an example given by either Arduino or Adafruit when you install
the ESP32 board. We used this to check if the camera was working. The ESP32CamSD-Forum.ino file is a tutorial we followed (https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-take-photo-save-microsd-card/).
