# Team SETTellite - ESP32-cam
In this folder is the code we used to get our ESP32-cam running. The camerawebserver.ino file is a litteral copy of the example, which can be found in the references-folder too. 
It got a webserver running, allowing us to see if the camera works. The ESP32CamSD is the code to get the ESP32 cam working and save the pictures on the SD card. The ESPCamSDNewName file
is the file to reset the PictureNumber variable, although it's just a copy of the ESP32CamSD file with one change and therefore overly complicated.
